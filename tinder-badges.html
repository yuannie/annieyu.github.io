        <div class="fullscreenText hideme">At <b><a href="https://tinder.com/">Tinder</a></b>, I worked on gameifying <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tinder-location-places/"><b>Places</b></a>, a location-based feature which brings people together based on their favorite places.</div>

        <div class="hideme"><img src="assets/tinderbadges/challenge.jpg"></div>

        <div class="fullscreenText hideme"><span class="subtitle">IDEATION</span> <br/>I sketched solutions varying from AR puzzles to community comments in each place.</div>

        <img class="hideme" src="assets/tinderbadges/sketches2.jpg">

        <div class="fullscreenText hideme">Some ideas strayed too far from dating, but <b>Badges</b>—a feature that rewards users for going out—was a perfect way to learn about their next date.</div>

        <img class="hideme" src="assets/tinderbadges/survivor.jpg">

        <div class="fullscreenText hideme"><span class="subtitle">INITIAL FLOW</span> <br/> After sketching, I mocked up how a user would obtain their first badge and learn about the badging system.</div>

        <img class="hideme" src="assets/tinderbadges/intialflow.jpg">

        <div class="fullscreenText hideme"><span class="subtitle">RESEARCH</span> <br/>I also looked into how <i>Snapchat, Yelp, PokemonGO, and Swarm</i> handled their badging systems.</div>

        <img class="hideme" src="assets/tinderbadges/research.jpg">

        <div class="fullscreenText hideme"><span class="subtitle">VISUAL EXPLORATION</span> <br/> After seeing their design treatments,I began experimenting with badge styles with ideas of transportation like stamps or luggage tags. </div>

        <img class="hideme" src="assets/tinderbadges/badges.jpg">

        <div class="fullscreenText hideme"><span class="subtitle"></span> <br/> In the end, I chose typical badge shapes since those were easier to understand.<br/><br/> After having sketched flows and reserached both UX and visual styles, I began prototyping. </div>

                    <span class="subtitle caption">Version 1—<i>badges in profile</i>
                </span> <span class="caption"><br/><br/>After a user visits enough art galleries or venues, for example, they earn a <i>Places</i> badge which they can view in their profile settings and other users can see when they view their profile.<br/><br/> These badges can say more about the user without them having to say it themselves. And the badge feels more legitimate because it is earned through the user's actions.</span></div>

                    <span class="subtitle caption">Final Version—<i>fullscreen takeover + badges in Places</i>
                </span> <span class="caption"><br/><br/><br/>After watching people interact with the prototype, I received feedback that the achievement modal could be more grand and exciting rather than contained in a modal. I made it a fullscreen takeover instead so it would feel more special. <br/><br/>People also found it confusing to navigate to Profile to see <i>Places</i> badges. Instead, I added a page within Places for people's badges so they felt the experience had more continuity.</span></div>

                    <span class="subtitle caption"></span> <span class="caption">I also mocked up the experience of when people are viewing others' profiles. They see the badges (and behaviors)  they have in common. <br/><br/> Mutual badges communicate the places and activities both love to engage in—making people feel more real without any more effort on the user's side.</span></div>
